# Hello Jupyter World
This repository serves as a "hello world" for a Jupyter Notebook docker container. The `docker-compose.yml` file allows you to add more containers if needed. 

When you're in the directory from which you want to start the docker container: 
- `docker-compose build` builds the docker image
- `docker-compose up` starts up a cluster defined by the docker-compose file
